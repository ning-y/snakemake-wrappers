#+TITLE: Liftover VCF from one assembly to another

* Example

#+begin_src
rule liftover:
    output: passes = "output.vcf", fails = "output.vcf.unmap"
    input:
        vcf = "input.vcf",
        chain = "hg38ToHg19.over.chain.gz",
        ref = "hg19.fa"
    wrapper: "https://github.com/ning-y/snakemake-wrappers/raw/ce06eed/crossmap/liftover"
#+end_src

* Parameters

- output.passes ::
  An output VCF file for records successfully lifted over.
- output.fails ::
  An output VCF file for records which failed to be lifted over.
  The name of this file must strictly be f"{output.vcf}.unmap" --- this seems to be hard-coded in crossmap.
- input.vcf ::
  A VCF or file, possibly bgzipped.
- input.chain ::
  A chain file.
- input.fa ::
  A FASTA file for the target assembly.
