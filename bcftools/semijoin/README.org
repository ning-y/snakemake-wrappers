#+TITLE: Semi join one VCF file against another

* Example

#+begin_src
rule combine_vcfs:
    output: "x.filtered.vcf.gz"
    input:
        subject = "x.vcf.gz",
        subject_tbi = "x.vcf.gz.tbi",
        object = "y.vcf.gz",
        object_tbi = "y.vcf.gz.tbi"
    wrapper: "https://github.com/ning-y/snakemake-wrappers/raw/870f4d7/bcftools/semijoin"
#+end_src

* Parameters

- input.subject ::
  An input bgzipped VCF file.
- input.subject_tbi ::
  Index to input.subject.
- input.object ::
  A filtering bgzipped VCF file.
- input.object_tbi ::
  Index to input.object.
- output ::
  An output file ending in "vcf.gz" if output should be bgzipped VCF, otherwise ".vcf" for VCF.

* Details

output is a VCF of records from input.subject which also appear in input.object.
Records are considered the same only if they have the same POS, REF, and ALT; i.e. it'd be a good idea to run [[../normalize][bcftools/normalize]] first.
