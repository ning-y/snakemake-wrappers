#+TITLE: Left-align and decompose multiallelic variants

* Example

#+begin_src
# Filter for passing variants
rule normalize_variants:
    input:
        vcf = "input.vcf.gz",
        tbi = "input.vcf.gz.tbi",
        fa = "ref.fa"
    output: "output.vcf.gz"
    wrapper: "https://github.com/ning-y/snakemake-wrappers/raw/237b312/bcftools/normalize"
#+end_src

* Parameters

- input.vcf ::
  An input bgzipped VCF file.
- input.tbi ::
  Index to input.vcf.
- input.fa ::
  Uncompressed reference FASTA file.
- output ::
  An output file ending in "vcf.gz" if output should be bgzipped VCF, otherwise ".vcf" for VCF.

* Details

Left-aligns indels, splits multiallelic records into biallelic ones (the ~--multiallelics - ~).
Once split, records with ~ALT="*"~ are removed, because they should already represented by upstream indels ([[https://web.archive.org/web/20210919051442/https://www.biostars.org/p/490448/][Biostars thread]]).

* Changelog
