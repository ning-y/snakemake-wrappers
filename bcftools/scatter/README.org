#+TITLE: Split VCF files into many chunks

* Example

#+begin_src
checkpoint scatter_vcfs:
    input: "input.vcf.gz"
    output: directory("scattered")
    params: output_type = "z", variants_per_chunk = 10000
    wrapper: "https://github.com/ning-y/snakemake-wrappers/raw/bee26e6/bcftools/scatter"
#+end_src

* Parameters

- input ::
  An input VCF file, possibly bgzipped
- output ::
  A directory to place output chunks
- params.output_type ::
  Output type for chunks: "b" for compressed, "u" for uncompressed BCF; "z" for compressed, "v" for uncompressed VCF
- params.variants_per_chunk ::
  Number of variants to include in each chunk

* Details

To perform a computation on the scattered chunks, write a rule with wildcards matching VCF files (or BCF, or whatever) in the output directory, which places its output in a second output directory.
Then, write another rule to concat all the VCF files (or whatever) in the second output directory, using an input function which infers the contents of the second output directory using this wrapper as checkpoint.
