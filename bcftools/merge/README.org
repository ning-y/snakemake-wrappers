#+TITLE: Merge VCF samples

* Example

#+begin_src
rule combine_vcfs:
    output: "merged.vcf.gz"
    input:
        targets = ["x.vcf.gz",     "y.vcf.gz"]
        indices = ["x.vcf.gz.tbi", "y.vcf.gz.tbi"]
    wrapper: "https://github.com/ning-y/snakemake-wrappers/raw/870f4d7/bcftools/merge"
#+end_src

* Parameters

- input.targets ::
  A list of input bgzipped VCF files to be merged.
- input.indices ::
  A list of indices to input.targets.
- output ::
  An output file ending in "vcf.gz" if output should be bgzipped VCF, otherwise ".vcf" for VCF.

* Details

No new multiallelic records are created (~--merge none~).
The indices in input.indices are not actually used --- they are just there to prompt Snakemake to check for their existence.
