#+TITLE: Subset samples from a VCF file

* Example

#+begin_src
# Subset a single sample
rule subset_vcf_sample:
    input: "input.vcf"
    output: "{sample_name}.vcf"
    params: lambda wc: samples = [wc.sample_name]
    wrapper: "https://github.com/ning-y/snakemake-wrappers/raw/43bc9d96/bcftools/subset-samples"

# Subset many samples
rule subset_vcf_sample:
    input: "input.vcf"
    output: "output.vcf"
    params: samples = ["SAMPLE1", "SAMPLE2"]
    wrapper: "https://github.com/ning-y/snakemake-wrappers/raw/43bc9d96/bcftools/subset-samples"
#+end_src

* Parameters

- input ::
  An input VCF or bgzipped VCF file.
- output ::
  An output file ending in "vcf.gz" if output should be bgzipped VCF, otherwise ".vcf" for VCF.
- params.samples ::
  A non-empty list of sample ID(s) to subset for.

* Details

Variants not in any of the subsetted samples, i.e. INFO/AC=0, are removed.
INFO/AC and INFO/AN are updated.

*NB.* If the input had INFO/AF, that field is no longer up-to-date.

* Changelog

- ~4f8c32e~ :: Remove variants not in subsetted samples
